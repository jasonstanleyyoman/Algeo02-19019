They pay a terrible price for their transgression\u2014Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\r\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\nEnglish: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n  \nSynonyms: Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Fullmetal Alchemist, Fullmetal Alchemist (2009), FMA, FMAB\n  \nJapanese: \u92fc\u306e\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u5e2b FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST\n  Elric, EdwardPark, RomiElric, AlphonseKugimiya, RieMustang, RoyMiki, ShinichiroHughes, MaesFujiwara, KeijiGreedNakamura, YuuichiHawkeye, RizaOrikasa, FumikoYao, LingMiyano, MamoruArmstrong, Alex LouisUtsumi, KenjiRockbell, WinryTakamoto, MegumiArmstrong, Olivier MiraSoumi, YokoCook, JustinIrie, YasuhiroMima, MasafumiSueda, Yoshifumi#1: \"again\" by YUI (eps 1-14)#2: \"Hologram (\u30db\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0)\" by NICO Touches the Walls (eps 15-26)#3: \"Golden Time Lover (\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc)\" by Sukima Switch (eps 27-38)#4: \"Period\" by Chemistry (eps 39-50)#5: \"Rain (\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3)\" by SID (eps 51-62)#1: \"Uso (\u5618)\" by SID (eps 1-14)#2: \"LET IT OUT\" by Miho Fukuhara (eps 15-26)#3: \"Tsunaida Te (\u3064\u306a\u3044\u3060\u624b)\" by Lil'B (eps 27-38)#4: \"Shunkan Sentimental (\u77ac\u9593\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb)\" by SCANDAL (eps 39-50)#5: \"RAY OF LIGHT\" by Nakagawa Shouko (eps 51-62)#6: \"Rain (\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3)\" by SID (ep 63)#7: \"Hologram (\u30db\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0)\" by NICO Touches the Walls (ep 64)Aniplex Square Enix Mainichi Broadcasting System Studio Moriken Funimation Aniplex of America Bones Action Military Adventure Comedy Drama Magic Fantasy Shounen Bones ", "Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0 Gintama\u00b0  Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura return as the fun-loving but broke members of the Yorozuya team!
